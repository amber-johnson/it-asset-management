# IT Asset Management Web Application

### Technologies/skills demonstrated
* React UI design and components
* Django Python-based web framework
* JSON objects
* REST API
* Unit testing
* Issue tracking
* Software demo

### Code samples
For an example of a table component I created in React using live data from the site, check out [ReportManagement.jsx](ece-458-design-project-master/app/hyposoft/frontend/src/components/management/ReportManagement/ReportManagementPage.jsx ).  From the landing page of our website, a user could navigate to the Reporting tab to see different statistics on their IT asset physical storage usage.

For a more involved example of a React component I create using live data from the site, check out [LogManagement.jsx](ece-458-design-project-master/app/hyposoft/frontend/src/components/management/LogManagement/LogManagementPage.jsx).  From the landing page of our website, a user could nagivate to the Logging tab to see a history of actions taken by different users within the app.

For an example of a utility I created in React, check out [ConfigurePermissions.jsx](ece-458-design-project-master/app/hyposoft/frontend/src/components/utility/ConfigurePermissions.jsx).  Because the application allowed for different users to have different permissions, this function could be called to return the permissions of the logged in user.  

### Background
I created this web application for my senior design project in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Duke University. The course was ECE 458: Engineering Software for Maintainability and was taught by Dr. Tyler Bletsch.  I was enrolled in the class Spring 2020 and worked on this project with three other seniors, two from the ECE Department and one from the Computer Science Department.
