### Background
I created this web application for my senior design project in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Duke University. The course was ECE 458: Engineering Software for Maintainability and was taught by Dr. Tyler Bletsch.  I was enrolled in the class Spring 2020 and worked on this project with three other seniors, two from the ECE Department and one from the Computer Science Department.
